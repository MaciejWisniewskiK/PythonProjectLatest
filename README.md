This repo is split into 2 packages, example data and a demo:
- DrugBankAnalyze is a package analyzing data given in drugbank's xml format, all functions are demonstrated in demo.ipynb
- DrugBankGenerate is a package generating a test database based on a smaller original one.

This repo is a reupload of MaciejWisniewskiK/PythonProject
This was necessary due to some commits of the older repo containing files over 100MB, which github doesn't accept.
Most of the history of commits is there.
